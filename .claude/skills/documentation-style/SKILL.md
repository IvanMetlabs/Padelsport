description: Consistent documentation style guide for this repo (tech + business docs).
---

Documentation rules:
- Keep docs concise and skimmable.
- Prefer examples, tables, and checklists.
- Never invent behavior: if unknown, mark “Needs confirmation” and ask a precise question.
- For business docs include: scope, roles, main flow, business rules, edge cases, glossary.
- For tech docs include: setup, config, run, API/contracts, troubleshooting.
