description: High-level overview of the project (purpose, architecture, main flows, and repo map).
---

When asked to explain the project from scratch, use this structure:

- What the product is and the problem it solves.
- Main actors/users and core business flows.
- Tech stack and key dependencies.
- Repo map: list the most important folders/files and what they contain.
- How to run locally (only if documented in the repo).
- Known limitations / TODOs (only if explicitly present).
